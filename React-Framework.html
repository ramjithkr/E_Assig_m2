        <h1>React Framework
        </h1>
        <p class="pg">Released by Facebook in 2011, React is a popular open-source JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. It focuses on the view layer of web applications and uses components to create reusable user interface elements. <br><br>

            Facebook developed the framework to fix code maintainability issues with their website, and it has since gained traction with developers. 
            
            React is popular for its performance, as it uses a virtual DOM, an in-memory representation of the actual DOM. This makes it faster and easier to render changes in the UI. React's one-way data flow makes it easier for developers to manage the state within their applications. Additionally, it's easy to learn and provides developers with powerful tools such as Redux for state management.
            
            Facebook also provides a complete framework called React Native, which helps developers create mobile applications.
            
            This framework, however, does have its drawbacks. Debugging can be challenging, and the codebase is not always straightforward. This is due to the many nested components that it presents.
            
            Additionally, React does not provide routing or state management out of the box, so developers must use third-party libraries to make these features work.
            
            Moreover, since the framework is constantly updated, keeping the documentation up to date can be challenging. This impacts the learning curve for beginners and makes it hard for developers to understand JSX when starting out with the framework.</p>
